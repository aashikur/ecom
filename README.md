# üõçÔ∏è ecom - Next.js 15 E-Commerce Showcase

## üìã Project Description

**ecom** is a simple, modern e-commerce application built with **Next.js 15 App Router** and secured with **NextAuth.js**. The application demonstrates a full-stack structure with public pages (landing, product list, and details) and a protected administrative dashboard for logged-in users to manage products. It uses **Route Handlers** for a mock backend to manage product data and handle authentication callbacks.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Public Access:** View the landing page, product list, and product details without logging in.
* **Authentication:** Secure login via **NextAuth.js** (supporting **Credentials** and/or **Social Login** like Google).
* **Protected Route:** A private dashboard to add new products, accessible only to authenticated users.
* **Data Handling:** Mock product data management using Next.js **Route Handlers** (`/api`).
* **Modern UI:** Built with best practices of the Next.js App Router, using **Server Components** and **Client Components**.
